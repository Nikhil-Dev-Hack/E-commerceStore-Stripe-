Is this course for you?

This course is very practical, about 90%+ of the lessons will involve you coding along with me on this project.  If you are the type of person who gets the most out of learning by doing, then this course is definitely for you.   

Important: If you have never coded before and you want to learn .Net and Angular you would be better starting with my other .Net Core and Angular course before this one.
